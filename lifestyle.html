      <h2>Chicago, Illinois</h2>
        <p>Why visit Chicago you ask? Does it have architecture and history? Art and culture?
          Does it have beer? Well, all of the above as it turns out, and much more.</br>It may be called the “Second City,” but Chicago plays second-fiddle to none.
           With stunning architecture, 40 world-class museums, over 200 theaters and more than 200 independent art galleries, 
          and over 7000 restaurants serving award-winning food, Chicago is a great place to visit for a weekend of culture, cuisine and history any time of year.
          But at no time does Chicago shine brighter than during the summer months. The Windy City is one of the most beautiful places to visit from June through
          September, when locals shake off the winter blues and take advantage of every last drop of summer sun. From eclectic street festivals to picnics in the park,
          running along the Lakefront and hitting the beach, there’s so much to do in Chicago during the summer. Here are nine reasons why you should add a visit to Chicago to your summer plans.</p>

            Welcome to O’Block has been pitched as Von’s debut album after a series of mixtapes and his “origin story.” The tragedy that has followed its release means 
            the project shoulders more of his legacy than Von could ever have intended.

            At 21, Juice WRLD had begun to master the world around him. He could wed the sounds of influences like Billy Idol and Chief Keef and create something entirely different. 
            As a songwriter, he could pair an airy melody with lyrics about heartbreak or drugs, and given the chance, fire off marathon freestyle sessions on a whim. A wunderkind with many imitators on SoundCloud, he sounded far more polished, far beyond whatever his closest peer was attempting to accomplish.

        <h2 class="w3-wide">The Fashion side</h2>
        <p class="w3-justify">From the ashes of the Chicago Fire of 1871 came the birth of the city's fashion scene as entrepreneurs built new storefronts virtually overnight. Aided by the Windy City's incredible network of railroads, these fledgling enterprises in turn created millionaires who wanted to wear the latest clothes from Europe. Marshall Fields and Potter Palmer were among the local elites who regularly boarded ships to France and returned with exquisite suits, coats, hats, gowns, fabrics, and other accessories, which designers sought to re-create with cheaper fabrics and labor. Chicago's reputation as a trendsetting metropolis was only sealed 
          by the city's film industry. Charlie Chaplin and his cast of stylish starlets had women north and south of Madison Street copying every hairdo and dress. Even after moviemaking moved to Los Angeles, actors and actresses traveling to New York City regularly dropped in when they switched trains downtown. By World War II, Chicago, the "City of Big Shoulders," became the place to start a career as a fashion designer.</p>

          Being one of the top cities in the US to visit, this city gives you a particular style setting especially when it comes to fashion.
          Whether you prefer the “woke up like this” look or an industrial-chic swag, Chicago has something interesting to offer you.
          It’s of the most fashionable cities in the US that most fashion-conscious individuals can visit. It’s also home to the SAIC Fashion Show, and Midwest Fashion Week.</p>

            <h2>Famous food in Chicago</h2>
            <p>We knew that the food would be good, but we were still blown away by the food quality at all price points.</br>
                We’ve already written about some of our excellent restaurant meals, but we also loved accessible local food like Chi dogs, 
                popcorn and donuts.</br>Even the local outpost of Eataly has its own twist, not to mention an enviable selection of fresh produce. Seriously, eating is one of the best things to do in Chicago. It is one of the best food cities in America after all.</p>
            <img src="img/coffe.jpg">
            <p>Experiencing genuine stuffed deep-dish pizza alone is reason enough to visit Chicago, but there is plenty of great food on offer. Alongside many great restaurants and bars, other local specialties include dripping Italian beef sandwiches loaded with sweet peppers and giardiniera, Chicago-style hot dogs, and popcorn, with the city’s favorite a mix of caramel and cheese corn. Just don’t call it Chicago mix—a company in St. Paul, Minnesota copyrighted that combination.</p>
